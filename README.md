### <span style="color:pink"> Objectives
The purpose of this project is to calculate the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficent.

The program must read numerical data from a file and compute the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. 
The data file should contain one value per line.

### <span style="color:pink"> How to run ?

To run your program, use the following command if your project is implemented in Go:
```
$ go run . data.txt
```
After reading the file, your program should execute the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient in the following format (example values are provided):
```
Linear Regression Line: y = <value>x + <value>
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: <value>
```

### <span style="color:pink"> How to test ?

- After downloading the file of test.

- To be able to run this script you need to have installed locally
 [`docker-engine`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- Run the script with `./bin/linear-stats`. The `<bin/linear-stats>` must be inside the `/bin` directory, then run the program with the created file *data.txt* by the previous command.
